Begin with “Contents” in Mind

CLINK LINK: Pomodoro Technique for Studying
Pomodoro Method
Decide on the task to be done.
Set the pomodoro timer (25 minutes).[2]
Work on the task.
End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.[6]
If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

Active Learning Methodology (ALM)
Active Learning Strategies help to initiate learners and instructors into effective ways to help everyone engage in activities based on ideas about how people learn. Multiple active learning strategies may be used in each of the active learning designs. Studies show implementing ALM can help with retaining dense information.

Audio Transcription by Abraham Ige
Mastering Your Cybersecurity Certification

Mastering your Cybersecurity Certification, my name is Abraham Ige and in this is the presentation that I will give to you in terms of finding the best certification for you as well as highlighting the benefits of stackable certifications, which will be discussed in this presentation moving forward. 

If you have any questions my email is listed here on the opening slide. My email is Abraham dot (pronounced e-gaye) i - g - e @ gmail dot com and we'll move into the presentation of mastering your cybersecurity certification. First I would like to begin with an overview that highlights a few topics that will be discussing the first one is what are stackable certifications. The next one is basic terminology and concepts. Strategies for passing the exam. How they can add value to your career and lastly the supplemental resources. 

Now we'll move into the first slide here. What are stackable certifications? Stackable certifications demonstrate that you have earned multiple certifications and have the knowledge and experience needed to grow your IT career, they validate the skills of your various IT roles and show a deeper mastery opening up more job opportunities for you. Stack will certifications are (important to note) require active CE certifications. 

These good for life certification holders may earn these stackable certifications by recertifying and validating that their skills are up to date. Now there are two paths here that we will discuss and I wanted to highlight here specifically with CompTia there are a few pathways that they have given to us which highlight a few areas are avenues that you can pursue when going for your certification and we'll discuss that more in depth as well, but just to highlight a few of them the CompTIA infrastructure career pathway  which is one way and the CompTIA Cyber Security Career Pathway, which is essentially the focus for this presentation. We're going to be looking more so in depth of the cyber security career pathway. Now it's also important to note that within each pathway come to your certifications are categorized rather by experience level there are three experience levels that they have here so a specialist for entry-level career IT professionals with zero to two years of experience professional which is your mid-level with two to five years of experience and lastly your expert which are of course essentially your established IT professionals with more than five years of experience. 

As we move to the next slide, I wanted to highlight the Top Five best certifications for 2020 and this is information given from InfoSec. They were the 2020 Cyber Defense Magazine winners in terms of their overall reputation and in this specific area. Number one is the Security+ is offered by a committee. A+ plus certification and the Network+ is at number two, and then we have the ISC squared associate certification for security. We have the GIAC security essentials or GSEC and then we have the CEH, which is the Certified Ethical Hacker. The source information is listed below if you would like to review that information in more detail. 

The next slide that we have here shows a progression chart for 2020 for security certifications highlighting the various industries and fields that you may find yourself in based on your experience and your exposure to I guess the field and the industry itself.

The six topics that are listed at the top are security management, security architecture, security, analysis, defensive operations, offensive operations and security engineering. Within each group, they have their varying levels or degrees of I guess experience within them, but I wanted to mainly highlight this slide because of the complexity and I guess the depth of information that exists within this specific field. 

There's so much that so many avenues or arteries that you can pursue and this area for security and just based on your experience of what might likely be your interest you may choose one over the other. As you're going to gather certain certifications as well, you can I guess tether them together or figure out which one best suits your needs with this specific graph and I know it's pretty dense this information is there's a lot to take in. 

They even highlight the Department of Defense certifications that are available and that if you want to work in that specific field there are certifications  that you will need along that line as well. I move to another slide which is a more simplified slide for us. 

The next one which highlights the two types of certifications. And please note that the asterisk asterix rather on this slide indicates that there is a stackable certification or mastery level available in the learning path offered by the Authorizing organization. 

The two types of certifications are vendor neutral certifications and vendor specific. 

Under the vendor neutral tab, we have highlighted the CompTIA certification paths, which for this presentation I decided to focus on this area specifically because they did offer the stackable certifications which gives you an added depth as well as added value to your career path that you choose or the certification path rather that you choose which is highly important in its more beneficial to you as an individual long term because you get an additional certification without possibly taking an additional exam or studying for a practical for example and CompTIA highlights that thoroughly. Now they're not the only I guess authorizing work organization that offers these types of mastery level certifications or stackable certifications, but they were one for a 2020 that really put a lot of work into their program and it's showcased at the most from my research. 

The other vendor neutral I guess authorizing organizations are the EC-Council which for example is your Certified Ethical Hacker certification that you would pursue ISC squared and the sans institute which will give you your GIAC certification. Now for the better for specific certifications where we have under that column a Cisco which would be your CCNA or your Cisco Certified Networking Associate which also has a path but it's vendor specific. 

We have Fortinet which for example you can pursue the NSE path the network security expert path splunk, which is a really good for SIEM; if you are looking to pursue that route it's actually recommended as well to really be well-rounded and it's one of the benefits of stackable certifications which we'll get into in depth later on. But the SIEM area here, they have a few paths, they have the core, the advanced and the expert path as well. 

But it's very important especially if you're going to be actively monitoring live threats. The software that's available for you there is really good to know. I would recommend that everyone pursues it, plus they have the cost associated with the actual exam is not very high. Lastly, we'll talk about the a AWS Certified Security Vendor Specific I guess certification that you can pursue in this area as well, which is also very important because a lot organizations in businesses are following the AWS cloud software as a service or infrastructure as a service pathway, which is an element that you would find kind of littered throughout the security knowledge realm. 

The next slide here we're looking at the two pathways. Now, we have the score the core skills certifications for Comptia and I again, I chose this path because when you're looking at the way that they developed the I guess the path here for learning there is a certain progression that really speaks volumes especially if you're applying for a certain positions and you want to show and highlight to your employer that you have not only learned the knowledge, you've understood it and and you have a I guess a stackable certification that highlights that you have a depth of learning that sets you apart from any other candidate. 

So you can see the progression here just gives you just the core skills and then also gives you the infrastructure pathway in addition to the cybersecurity pathway, which once you have passed the security plus which is a really one of the pivotal points here one of the pivotal certifications that you can get you can move on to pursue maybe your Pentest+ and that would take you down the security pathway. 

In contrast if you wanted to go more so on the infrastructure pathway, you could pursue the Server+  certification and that would take you along that infrastructure pathway as you study but as you see we can see there's also a lot of interplay as well with the certifications which makes it a really good avenue to choose when thinking and I guess mapping out your strategy for taking and studying these certifications and what's required required from you in this specific roles as well. 

The next slide that we have is actually the infrastructure pathway again but it highlights as well the different areas that actually the certifications rather that actually turn into stackable search for you. And again, the stackable certifications means that if you complete two or more certifications, then you would get an additional cert from the authorizing organization such as CompTIA without doing any additional studying. 

There's just a little note here. I'll highlight the path for you for instance. I know when I took it there's a specialist path. And along the specialist path you can take the a plus network plus and the security plus and they'll give you a CSIS certification. Which is a really important and it’s an additional certification that highlights you as a I guess an as a specialist in that area showing that you've completed all three but at the end you would get a fourth certification which you could list and of course you would have that badge listed on your possibly your LinkedIn website or maybe you're Acclaim profile as well that employers are recruiters can refer back to and see that that you've actually completed the certification. 

But a lot of the stackable certifications that we see here on this page for the specialist is for the CSIS for example at the bottom, it shows you the acronyms mean the Secure Infrastructure Specialist and there's a few other ways as well actually there's a good number. 12 for CompTIA as of yet and we see here even just the A+ and the network plus you'll you'll get to see I OS certification which is the Comptia IT Operation Specialist Certification and for anyone that's coming in entry level you would typically fall within those categories which is which is a good thing to have you can have an additional you take two exams and we'll get into the details of the exam structure later on as well, but then at the end of your exam the authorizing organization come to you would also highlight that you've completed those exams and give you a third certification at no expense no cost to you. 

Now we're jumping town down rather to the basic terminologies and concepts for security and I just to highlight this just briefly because it's something that you'll see no matter which tests or exam that you or career path that you choose in terms of the certifications, you'll constantly see these terms pop up so if we just take a quick glance of the screen here to internalize the information for cybersecurity, which is the largest term that you would see on this screen here will. Also see auditing which is very important government of a data, you know also staying in compliance with the certain regulatory boards is also very important we see passwords logs which are always come up because it's one of the main ways that we can track the history of activity on our systems or across the network just some of the basic terminology that you would see in the I guess the day-to-day job that you would be working in. It's also good to have the notes as a resource or the slides rather as a resource; I'll make sure to post this and if you have any questions you can always reach out to me as well. 

I'll go ahead and continue with the next slide continue with the same theme of the basic terms and concepts we see a little bit more of a granular approach here with the next slide so some of the terms that are highlighted here, we see antivirus software that is designed to detect stop and remove viruses and any other kinds of malicious software. 

Firewall to factor-authentication, botnet, denial of service social engineering. Spearfishing encryption white listing or? Definition of cyber attack, which is a malicious attempt to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized access to computer systems networks or devices via cyber means and zero day. A zero day is a recently discovered vulnerability or bug not yet known to the vendors or antivirus companies that hackers can exploit so these are some of the the basic terms and concepts that we will see kind of jump off the page which if it's a vendor specific or a vendor neutral exam that you'll take you'll definitely see these show up on the exam or within in some shape form of fashion and at the same time it's just it's really good information to know and to be aware of. 

We'll move to the CIA Triad. The CIA triad is a really integral portion of cybersecurity because it highlights the basis and really the crux of information security when. Thinking and talking about securing your data. This is one of the concepts that you will see in almost all cases and confidentiality rather is protecting confidentiality, which is dependent on being able to define and enforce certain access levels for information. 

And this in intern in terms of say for instance, for example in the healthcare industry, you will be dealing with or you would deal with PHI which is Protected Health Information or personal information PII personal identifiable information and willing to want to make sure it all cause that you keep that information confidential and in in certain instances, maybe if you're doing a business to business or if you have a certain contract a relationship you want to make sure that the data is encrypted and in transit and communication via email at all cost. At the same time that no I guess unauthorized parties are able to have access to that information because they could have a negative income impact on the business if that information were to be exposed. 

We'll move to the next I guess element of the CIA triad, which is integrity. Integrity is what the eye and CIA triad stands for; this is an essential component of the CIA triad and I like to think of integrity as maintaining the data. In its original state from point A to point B. And by that, I mean in transit if data has changed then. The integrity of that data that's on the move would be forfeited. And a lot of times you will see within studying the text for one of the exams here. I'll just use security plus for example. 

I know it's one that I've studied for. One of the ways that integrity can be kept is by hashing hashing is a means for you to identify and create a specific string of information to mask your communication or a specific file, give it a certain identity a certain key, which is identifiable but in a certain way, ensures rather that the data has not changed. So if the email that you are sending has the same hash or the file that you're I guess downloading has the same hash on your computer as when it reaches its destination the receiver then you can identify the file hasn't changed and there's no malicious software on that file or communication. 

Next we'll move to availability which is the final component of the CIA Triad and it refers to the actual availability of your data. I like to think of this as just making sure that with your business partners even as a business in general the idea is to constantly stay in business right because everything excuses me, everything is for-profit even in non-profit organizations, you'll want to make sure that your organization will stay up or have the most uptime. 

Possible the optimal uptime or optimal scenario possible. With availability. For instance with social media websites you want to make sure that those sites stay up for you know, Facebook the site you want to make sure that the individuals that participate in you know, Facebook and communicating with their family and friends can always have access to that. Or if you think about other services personal services say for instance even in telecommunications with a you know, a provider or internet service provider, you want to make sure that your services can always be available to your customers that way you don't lose business or potentially gain a bad reputation with your customers or customer base. So one of the ways that you can curve the availability or ensure that you have availability for your customers is to possibly have generators at your sites to counteract the impact of a power outage, for example. 

UPS is a unified power supply rather than a unified power supply that will give you constant power if a power outage does occur then you will at least have maybe about four hours to react to the power outage and ensure that your customers still have access to your services. 

Moving on to the next slide we'll talk about the OSI model. The OSI model rather is the open systems interconnection model and there's seven layers. In this slide here, I just wanted to give this to you and show it at a glance and because it's something that you will constantly see coming or come up in your studies and and we'll talk about it a little bit but because this slide is very dense, but I did want to keep it as a reference for you because there's so much information that you can take from it, especially this one in particular. 

The basic components of the OSI model here is listed on the left at each specific layer and there's a mnemonic to help you remember it as well but starting from the bottom up will talk about the the physical layer, the data link layer, the networking layer, the transport layer, the session layer, the presentation layer and the application layer. 

And all of these layers actively work together to give you the tools necessary to communicate across networks to you know, your friends and family and even just at your host system all of these tools there's a certain interplay that happens as well just to give you a certain user experience. In your studies as a security professional you'll see that at each level there's a specific way that you'll have to secure each layer; which is extremely important to think about and in that context. So I just wanted to highlight this just as some of the basic concepts and in terms that you were seeing your studies and to use it as a reference point for you to follow up on as well.


Next, I'll talk about the strategies for passing the exam. I felt this was very important because after listening to individuals who have taken certain exams and after taking exams myself, I feel like sometimes when you go into your personal study to research to study for an exam, you might be working at the same time as well. There's a lot of information and it's extremely complex and dense as well. But there are strategies to help you along the way; but it takes time you have to research them. 

Here I've brought to light and I guess highlighted a few of the ones that I felt were extremely valuable for me and I've heard that it's also worked for many individuals and they've successfully completed their exams and obtained their certifications which is one step closer to mastery. Finding a stackable certification and making sure that your employer knows that you have the tools necessary to complete your job; as well as the skill set and knowledge base. 

So strategies for passing the exam. The different learning strategies rather that we’ll talk about. The first one we’ll cover is the pomodoro method. The next one is the active learning methodology or ALM and then the last one is just a phrase here just begin with contents in mind (and contents meaning the contents page of any of the books).

So we'll start with the pomodoro method. 

There's a link provided here if you want to study this technique or research this technique rather and more depth it's available to you here and you can yeah I guess use it in many ways and many forms particularly for retention which is extremely important. I felt it's a health me along the way when studying so many complex pieces of information and so many components that make up what could be potentially the Security+ exam or maybe the Network+ exam. Any of the exams even the Certified Ethical Hacker examination as well, there's so many concepts and so many terms/acronyms that you have to internalize but the Pomodoro method gives you a strategy for attacking those things head on and successfully; and retaining the information along the way. 

So let's jump right into it. 

The idea behind the pomodoro method is to ensure that you have enough time to rest and to really retain the information. Just in short that's the basis of the method because a lot of times which you'll find is that you'll see a 824 page book and you'll think oh my gosh, how can I get through this, you know, so many chapters it could be maybe 18 or 19 chapters that you would have to read and each chapter has it's own it almost when you think about it it's like almost it's own language because it's covering a certain area within security that could be extremely complicated such as cryptography; which is just one area of security and then another area could be vulnerabilities/threats, Malware, Risks; there's so many different topics that you'll cover in security and this is just one of the strategies that you can use to help along the way to internalize the information to give you a bit of calmness when studying rather these complex comes concepts. 

So the just kind of enumerated we have listed here is decided on the tasks to be done is number one. 

The next step here is to set the pomodoro timer to 25 minutes and if you are familiar with the pomodoro timer rather, it's time that you use something that you can find in the kitchen it will use well while baking you just set the timer to a certain time and by the end of that time you're able to come back to whatever is being cooked or whatever is in the oven check on it and you know just ensure that you haven't overdone it for lack of better terminology. 

But it's a great analogy to use in terms of the method to study or you know, the method that you can use to set your mind on when studying security. 

Number three, we have to work on the task number four says in the work when the timer rings and put a check mark on a piece of paper. 

Number five, if you have fewer than four check marks, take a short break, which is typically three to five minutes and then go back to step two. After four pomodoros or iterations take a longer break which is 15 to 30 minutes reset your check mark count to zero then go to step one and what this does is really it really creates a space and allows you to rest and really internalize the information that you've just read and in the meantime you'll find yourself thinking of you know, the information that was given in like how you can apply that information you'll start drawing more connections and it's just a better strategy for learning and internalizing so much information and then not to scare you or anything like that, but at the same time to make aware the strategies that you can use because people you know, when you look at it on the surface you think that this, you know, it's it's very challenging to to run through a lot of these concepts into obtain the certification, but there are individuals who are successful at it and there's many individuals at that as well, so it's just a strategy that you have to do or that you have to use rather, maybe if you're working or set time aside to make sure that you do well and that you achieve the end goal that you're looking forward to; which is obtaining the certification. 

The next learning strategy we have is the ALM or Active Learning Methodology and the Active Learning Strategy helps to initiate learners and instructors into effective ways to help everyone engage in activities based on ideas about how people learn. 

Multiple active learning strategies may be used in each of the active learning designs and studies show implementing ALM can help with retaining dense information. There’s an article that's linked here to this slide, which I feel is very useful, it's helped me a lot in terms of my studies as well. 

I just just to think and reflect on how individuals learn the psychology behind it and it really opens up your mind to. The different tools that you have at your disposal that you might not have been exposed to before but this active learning strategy is very important and I recommend it for anyone that's pursuing this security certification and any capacity. 

Next we have. The “Begin with Contents” in Mind and I spoke with I would I would call an a mentor who came to speak to us as I was working through a cyber security program myself and he told us about different strategies that he used and one of them that he had highlighted he's he's actually working to develop or publish a book or a notebook or tool for us to have to read on active learning strategies the pomodoro method, for example just different tools that he used to obtain I believe in his article that he wrote. I believe he obtained his master's in six months. So you can imagine taking a master's program, which is typically supposed to be 18 months to two years. Six months. He condensed all of that information and was able to complete it and he's what he's done is taking that learning methodology that he's used to complete the six-month Master program in cybersecurity and stripped away that information to give us the best tools necessary when learning and just working/operating at a high level. 

And one of the things that it was a big takeaway was the begin with content or contents in mind which you mentioned is like when you open any of the books take a really good look at the contents page, the contents page will highlight the topics that you're familiar with and the ones that you aren't but the important thing to remember is as you read each chapter refer back to the contents page, and as you as those lights go off in your head and you start to get those, ah-ha Moments and really understanding the information tie that back to the contents page makes no make notes rather on the context page where you see the two concepts align or there's a correlation of information there. 

I know it's easy to overlook because it's the contents page many people just kind of gloss right over it, but if you use that one simple strategy, it can really go a long way. 

This concludes the learning strategies. I have for this presentation and will continue with the remainder of the information. 

The case study that was given is the Security+ exam from CompTIA; just as an additional method or study materials that you have there at your disposal one of the things that came to mind here. I felt it would be very important for anyone who's in industry or you know, any you know IT professional that's looking to take this exam one of the tools that I felt that was a very important for me; I just wanted to go ahead and in highlight those as well and speak to them a little bit so the first thing when you're taking any of the exams which this this is it can be used as a kind of cookie cutter model for any other exam that you're taking along the way beat a plus or network plus any of the entry levels certifications Linux+ or Linux based certifications, or if you're taking the Certified Ethical Hacker path server path all of these study methods can come and play so the first thing that I saw here that's important is what's recommended is for anyone taking the exam to first print off the objectives for each exam and this goes it kind of speaks. 

To begin with contents in mind from our previous discussion and previous slide, the objectives that you'll see will be listed out in a specific order for you to read. And typically the the exam study material and also the books will be laid out in this order as well, which is really good for you to keep at your exercise while you're studying you can use it as a place to kind of check off your material if you're using the Pomodoro method once you've completed a concept and you feel like you're thoroughly understand it, it's just a really good guide to keep at your side so that you know and have a placeholder to kind of guide you along the way as you're studying this material. 

The next point here actually speaks to the same point which is to draw connections to the index or the contents page and exam objectives as you study. 

A strategy for depth and learning and complexity protection are retention rather. Is to utilize flashcards. I know it's something that you might have done, back in high school or even middle school but it's something that is highly important in this respect when you're studying this setting for any exam of this nature. 

I've also listed some online resources available to you if you're going to come to your route there's a few things that you can use that will help substantially in your studies. The CompTIA to your Cert Master practice exams, which are online you can register for that. That information is very powerful because it gives you an idea of the type of questions that you will see or that you would likely see on an exam and you can begin to familiarize yourself with the structure of those questions and also the layout for the PBQs. The PBQs which are the performance-based questions and it's highly important that you expose yourself to these questions and their structures so you can become familiar and you won't be surprised when you're taking the exam.

Next we have the author Darryl Gibson who has the Security+ 501 the most current security certification that you can take in his material is very useful. He also has online resources available to you that you can use that are very important. And lastly I would recommend Dr. Messer and both links are available but his online training courses that he has on YouTube are very useful. I've read consistently on various sites and also speaking with different individuals who have taken in the past the exam that these are the tools that they've used to help them along the way. 

Next we'll talk about how they can add value to your career. The value proposition for stackable certifications is that it shows a high level of mastery of a given topic within the context of cyber security. The progression with respect to each subject area, let's employers know that you've deepened your understanding of the knowledge and it's also a way of saying that I learned it, I understand it and I proved it. 

The value of certifications, we’ll talk about the ability or the skills to get a new job you're able to preserve your current job and salary. If you're ready to change jobs the certification's help any candidate qualify for new job opportunities or advance their career in technology. The next is that it makes you stand out. in the resume pile a lot of times you'll be using the models. 



Now the last one says that IT is everywhere and this is important because. There is a lack of security professionals within the industry and in various industries and now because there is a kind of push in a influx of individuals that are looking to pursue this path it says that the IT skills are needed or that are needed in most companies, they're simply not enough trained IT professionals to fill this job so pursuing this route, it can be extremely beneficial to you. 

I won't talk about the salary or anything like that. I think it mostly varies and at the same time it's dependent on the path that you choose but compensation is something that I believe it's definitely going to be there. I won't really go in depth on it, but pursuing a route and obtaining a certification is definitely the way to go.

Next out, I’ll Kind of give you an overview. Of the different sites like simply hired indeed. LinkedIn jobs and tech careers these certifications that really offer the most hiring or that have the most positions available that you'll see here for security plus here it shows a total across all four of those sites of almost 11 or yeah, it's over 11,000 positions available even another one CISSP which is authorized by the ISC squared. 

That one is above 50,000 positions, so there's so many positions available but are there individuals that are trained and that have obtained rather this certification to fill those positions. (I just wanted to highlight this and keep it as a reference just to show you the benefit and I would encourage anyone else who is researching maybe a specific certification or path that they would like to take to also look for information that mirrors this as well. This comes from the business news daily website that was an article there and the sources linked down below so if you want to review that we'll give you more in-depth information for each certification listed. 

Lastly, I have the supplemental resources for you. These additional resources will give you the roadmap for each specific certification board. CompTIA, Cisco, the ISC squared, the EC-Council. If you're interested in taking the Splunk Certification that one is available to you as well. ISACA is available. Fortinet, AWS certified security there's a link for that as well as the SANSs Institute.

Lastly, I have the springboard link which I felt. With a really good blog and an article about cybersecurity certifications that I felt was important to have. So now the five minute activity that I listed here if you're looking for certifications. I want you to just take five minutes quickly and start with a few questions to ask yourself. 

Ask yourself, what would I like to do? And also ask yourself which certifications are most valuable to me. I think this really helps in the process of kind of getting out of the weeds. As you can recall the first or one of the earliest slides had almost every single certification that you could take within the cybersecurity industry and field but it's so parsed out and it's  like there's so much information that it's like where do I start? 

It's like one of the first questions that you have but if, You can't decide, I also have a resource for you. This one comes directly from CompTIA and it's really geared towards stackable certifications. It helps you find your perfect stack. So there's a few just a few questions that it asked that you would take and then it would give you your stack based on your answers to those questions, which I found was really helpful and actually opened my eyes. 

It was a path that I did not think was something that I should take but based on my responses it has me thinking about, you know, researching those certifications a little bit more in-depth as well. 

If you have any questions at least listen to my information here again, my name is Abraham Ige, my contact information is listed below. I am a graduate of the Cybersecurity Program at Vanderbilt University and I am a certified Google IT support professional. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn as well the QR code is in the bottom right hand corner of the last slide here and I will be glad to answer any of your questions. 

Thank you.
